Bcfg2 - Sample Repository
-------------------------

The Bcfg2 examples repository contains example files for various Bcfg2
generators and plugins.  Those files may not work in your environment
without manual configuration.  Others can be obsolete from time to time.
The only purpose is to give you a entry point for your own
configuration.

Do you have a configuration which could be useful for other?  Do you want
to share your knowledge with the community?  The easiest way to get your
stuff integrated in the Bcfg2 examples is to fork the git respository and
to place a pull request.
