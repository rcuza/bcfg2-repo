Bcfg2 - Sample Repository
-------------------------

The Bcfg2 examples repository contains example files for various Bcfg2
generators and plugins.  Those files may not work in your environment
without manual configuration.  Others can be obsolete from time to time.
The only purpose is to give you a entry point for your own
configuration.
